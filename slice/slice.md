# Go Arrays and Slices Example

This project demonstrates how to work with arrays and slices in Go. It includes basic operations like copying data from a slice to an array, viewing the elements of both, and adding new tasks to the slice dynamically.

## Code Explanation

### Arrays in Go

In Go, arrays are fixed in size, and the size must be specified at the time of initialization. In this example, an array `arr` of size 100 is defined. However, it is initialized with empty string values.

```go
var arr [100]string
